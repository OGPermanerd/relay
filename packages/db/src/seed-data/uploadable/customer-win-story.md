## Inputs
- **Customer Name**: {{customer}} (check if they've approved being named publicly)

## Story Structure

### Headline
Compelling one-liner that leads with the result:
"[Customer] reduced [metric] by [X%] in [timeframe] with [Product]"

### The Challenge (2-3 paragraphs)
Set the scene — what was the customer dealing with before us?
- Business context and pain points
- Previous solutions they tried
- What was at stake if they didn't solve it

### The Solution (2-3 paragraphs)
How did they find and implement our product?
- Why they chose us over alternatives
- Implementation highlights
- Key features they use

### The Results (2-3 paragraphs)
Quantified impact:
- Primary metric improvement (with numbers)
- Secondary benefits
- Team and organizational impact
- Future plans with the product

### Pull Quote
Highlighted customer quote — ideally from an executive or team lead.

## Output Formats
Generate all three:
1. **Full Case Study** (800-1200 words) — for website and sales collateral
2. **One-Pager** (300-400 words) — for sales leave-behinds
3. **Social Post** (150 words) — for LinkedIn/Twitter announcement

## Guidelines
- Lead with results, not features
- Use specific numbers whenever possible
- Keep jargon appropriate for the target audience
- Include the customer's industry context so prospects can self-identify
- Get approval from the customer before publishing
