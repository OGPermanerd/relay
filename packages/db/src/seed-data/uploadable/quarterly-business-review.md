## Formatting Guidelines
- Use data visualizations where possible (charts, trend lines)
- Keep slides to one idea each — no walls of text
- Include the customer's logo and branding
- Total presentation should be 15-20 slides
- Leave time for discussion — QBR is a conversation, not a monologue

## Tips for Delivery
- Send the deck 24 hours before the meeting so stakeholders can review
- Start by asking what topics they want to cover — adapt on the fly
- End with a clear mutual plan, not just our recommendations
- Schedule the next QBR before leaving the room
