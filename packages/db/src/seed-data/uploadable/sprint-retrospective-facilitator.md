# Sprint Retrospective Facilitator

Run effective sprint retrospectives that surface real issues and produce actionable improvements.

## Inputs
- **Sprint**: {{sprint}} (sprint number or date range)
- **Team**: {{team}}
- **Sprint Goal**: {{goal}} — what the team committed to
- **Sprint Outcome**: {{outcome}} — what was actually delivered
- **Format**: {{format}} (standard / 4Ls / sailboat / timeline / starfish)

## Retro Format: Standard (What Went Well / What Didn't / Actions)

### Opening (5 min)
Set the stage:
- "This is a safe space. We focus on improving the process, not blaming people."
- Review the Prime Directive: "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time."

### Data Gathering (10 min)
Silent brainstorming — each person writes sticky notes (virtual or physical):
- What went well? (green)
- What didn't go well? (red)
- What puzzled me? (yellow)

### Group & Vote (10 min)
- Group similar items into themes
- Dot vote: each person gets 3 votes for items they want to discuss

### Discuss Top Items (20 min)
For the top 3-5 voted items:
- What happened?
- Why did it happen?
- What can we change?

### Action Items (5 min)
- Maximum 2-3 concrete actions per retro
- Each action has an owner and a deadline
- Review action items from last retro: completed? dropped? still in progress?

## Alternative Formats

### 4Ls (Liked / Learned / Lacked / Longed For)
Good for teams that struggle with "what didn't go well" framing.

### Sailboat
- Wind (what pushed us forward)
- Anchor (what held us back)
- Rocks (risks ahead)
- Island (our goal)

### Starfish
- Keep doing
- More of
- Less of
- Stop doing
- Start doing

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Skipping the retro because "we're too busy" — that's when you need it most
- Same issues appearing retro after retro without action
- One person dominating the conversation
- Turning it into a blame session
- Creating too many action items (max 3)
- Not following up on previous action items
