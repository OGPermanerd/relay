## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- MCP Integration moved to Phase 3 (from Phase 8) to enable usage tracking from day one. Core metric (FTE Days Saved = uses x hours) requires real usage data.
- E2E testing with Playwright added to Phase 1 to ensure served pages can be validated automatically from the start.
- Inlined Tailwind theme in apps/web/globals.css - CSS imports from workspace packages not supported by Next.js build.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Node.js version warning (v20 vs required v22) - works but shows warning on pnpm commands.
