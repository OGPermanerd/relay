## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v1.2:
- nuqs for URL state: Consistent with existing CategoryFilter/TagFilter patterns
- No TanStack Table: Overkill for single-column sort; Server Components handle data transformations
- Keep totalUses/avgRating in LeaderboardEntry for backward compatibility (12-03)
- Date format "MMM D" for compact contribution date display (12-03)
- Plain HTML table for SkillsTable (shadcn/ui Table not in codebase, follow existing pattern) (12-01)
- Header/filters outside TwoPanelLayout for full-width styling (12-02)
- days_saved as default sort order (12-02)
- Toggle pattern for author filter: clicking same author clears filter (13-04)
