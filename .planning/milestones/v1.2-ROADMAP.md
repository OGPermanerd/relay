# Milestone v1.2: UI Redesign

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-02
**Phases:** 12-14
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Redesign the UI with a two-panel sortable table layout featuring inline expansion, one-click install, and full accessibility support.

## Phases

### Phase 12: Two-Panel Layout Foundation

**Goal**: Users see skills in a functional two-panel layout with sortable table and leaderboard
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (existing browse page serves as baseline)
**Requirements**: LAYT-01, TABL-01, TABL-04, TABL-05, TABL-10, LEAD-01, LEAD-02
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User sees skills table occupying left 2/3 of screen with leaderboard in right 1/3
  2. Table displays all six columns: skill name, days_saved, installs, date added, author handle, sparkline
  3. Table is sorted by days_saved descending by default
  4. User can type in search bar and see filtered results
  5. Leaderboard shows contributors with handle, total days_saved, contribution count, and latest date
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md - Two-panel layout and skills table components
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md - Data layer extension and page wiring
- [x] 12-03-PLAN.md - Leaderboard column updates

### Phase 13: Interactive Sorting & Accordion

**Goal**: Users can interactively sort the table and expand rows to see skill details and install
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: TABL-02, TABL-03, TABL-06, TABL-07, TABL-08, TABL-09, LEAD-03
**Success Criteria**:
  1. User can click any column header to sort ascending, click again to sort descending
  2. Active sort column shows direction indicator (chevron up/down)
  3. User can click a row to expand inline accordion showing description and usage instructions
  4. Multiple rows can be expanded simultaneously without collapsing others
  5. User can click Install button in expanded row to copy skill to clipboard
  6. Sort state persists in URL (user can share sorted view via link)
  7. User can click a contributor in leaderboard to filter table to that author's skills
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md - Sorting infrastructure (URL state hook, sortable column headers)
- [x] 13-02-PLAN.md - Accordion and install infrastructure (expansion hooks, install button, accordion content)
- [x] 13-03-PLAN.md - SkillsTable integration (client conversion, sorting, accordion rows)
- [x] 13-04-PLAN.md - Author filtering (leaderboard click, filter chip, URL persistence)

### Phase 14: Mobile & Accessibility Polish

**Goal**: Users can access all features via keyboard and mobile devices with full screen reader support
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: LAYT-02, A11Y-01, A11Y-02, A11Y-03
**Success Criteria**:
  1. On mobile viewport, panels stack vertically with skills table above leaderboard
  2. User can navigate entire table using only keyboard (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
  3. Accordion rows announce expanded/collapsed state to screen readers
  4. Sort indicators are announced to screen readers (aria-sort on columns)
**Plans:** 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md - Responsive layout (sm: breakpoint, horizontal scroll)
- [x] 14-02-PLAN.md - Accessibility infrastructure (roving tabindex hook, live region announcer)
- [x] 14-03-PLAN.md - Sort column accessibility (aria-sort, sort announcements)
- [x] 14-04-PLAN.md - Collapsible leaderboard (login count tracking, onboarding behavior)
- [x] 14-05-PLAN.md - Table row accessibility & gestures (keyboard nav, ARIA, swipe-to-install)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- nuqs for URL state: Consistent with existing CategoryFilter/TagFilter patterns
- No TanStack Table: Overkill for single-column sort; plain HTML table sufficient
- Plain HTML table: shadcn/ui Table not installed, follow existing leaderboard pattern
- Header/filters outside TwoPanelLayout: Full-width styling preserved
- days_saved as default sort: Most impactful skills first
- Toggle pattern for author filter: Click same author clears filter
- sm: breakpoint (640px) for mobile stacking: Phones stack, tablets+ side-by-side
- W3C APG Grid Pattern for keyboard navigation
- aria-live="polite" for non-interruptive announcements
- 5 sessions as onboarding threshold for collapsible leaderboard
- 80px delta threshold for swipe gesture activation

**Issues Resolved:**
- TypeScript error with swipeHandlers ref spread resolved by moving spread before ref
- Initial mount announcement avoided via useRef flag

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
