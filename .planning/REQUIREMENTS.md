# Requirements: EverySkill v6.0 IP Dashboard & Skills Portfolio

**Defined:** 2026-02-15
**Core Value:** Protect and grow your IP. Fast. Skills get better as they pass through more hands, with real metrics proving that value.

## v6.0 Requirements

Requirements for IP Dashboard & Skills Portfolio milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Company IP Dashboard

- [ ] **IPDASH-01**: Admin can view total skills captured, total uses, total hours saved, and active contributors on a company IP dashboard
- [ ] **IPDASH-02**: Admin can see IP concentration risk — which employees hold the most critical skills (single-author skills with high usage)
- [ ] **IPDASH-03**: Admin can see estimated replacement cost for each high-value skill based on usage, hours saved, and complexity
- [ ] **IPDASH-04**: Admin can view org-wide quality trends over time (quality scores, feedback sentiment, benchmark results as trend charts)
- [ ] **IPDASH-05**: Admin can see key person dependency alerts when critical skills have only one author
- [ ] **IPDASH-06**: Admin can export an IP Report (PDF/CSV) summarizing IP captured, risk assessment, and estimated value for board presentations

### Individual Skills Portfolio

- [ ] **PORT-01**: User can view their personal skills portfolio showing skills authored, total usage, total hours saved, and contribution ranking
- [ ] **PORT-02**: User can see a portable vs company IP breakdown — which skills are personal-scoped (theirs forever) vs tenant-scoped (company's)
- [ ] **PORT-03**: User can view a skills impact timeline showing when they created/improved skills and cumulative impact over time
- [ ] **PORT-04**: User can generate a "Skills Resume" — a shareable, formatted summary of their skills and impact for use in job applications
- [ ] **PORT-05**: User can see an impact calculator showing how much value they have added to the company over time through their contributions to the skillset
- [ ] **PORT-06**: User can load pre-LLM history (emails, documents produced, prior work artifacts) to demonstrate historical impact and inform skill recommendations

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time collaboration on skills | High complexity, not core to IP stewardship value |
| Financial accounting integration | IP valuation is estimation-based, not accounting-grade |
| Legal IP ownership assignment | Platform shows visibility scope, not legal ownership — that's HR/legal |
| Automated skill migration between tenants | Security and IP ownership implications require manual process |
| Pre-LLM history auto-import from all sources | v6.0 covers manual upload; automated connectors deferred to v7.0 |
