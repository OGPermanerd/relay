### 🚧 v7.0 Algorithm & Architecture Rewrite (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Implement research-backed algorithmic infrastructure -- GraphRAG communities, adaptive query routing, temporal tracking, extended visibility, multi-model benchmarking -- to make the "smart skills database" promise real.

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (69, 70, 71...): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (69.1, 69.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [x] **Phase 69: Extended Visibility** - Expand from 2 to 4 visibility levels with cross-tenant RLS and 15+ query site updates (completed 2026-02-16)
- [x] **Phase 70: MCP Preference Sync** - MCP tools for reading/writing user preferences with search boost integration (completed 2026-02-16)
- [ ] **Phase 71: Temporal Tracking** - Track user-skill interactions to surface "what changed since you last looked"
- [ ] **Phase 72: Community Detection** - Build similarity graph and cluster skills into thematic communities
- [ ] **Phase 73: Community Discovery UI** - AI-generated community labels, browse page, and detail page
- [ ] **Phase 74: Adaptive Query Routing** - Classify search queries and route to optimal retrieval strategy
- [ ] **Phase 75: RAGAS Benchmarking** - 4-dimension quality scoring with radar visualization and backward-compatible overall score

## Phase Details

### Phase 69: Extended Visibility
**Goal**: Users and admins can manage skills across 4 graduated visibility levels with correct tenant isolation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first v7.0 phase)
**Requirements**: VIS-01, VIS-02, VIS-03, VIS-04, VIS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Skills can be created with any of the 4 visibility levels (global_approved, tenant, personal, private) and the selection persists correctly
  2. A user in tenant A can see global_approved skills from tenant B in search results, but cannot see tenant B's tenant-scoped skills
  3. Only users with admin role can set or change a skill's visibility to global_approved
  4. Trending, leaderboard, portfolio, and all other aggregate views correctly include/exclude skills based on the new visibility levels (no silent disappearances, no inappropriate inclusions)
  5. All existing skills with "tenant" or "personal" visibility continue to behave identically to before the change
**Plans:** 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 69-01-PLAN.md -- Visibility foundation: helpers, schema, migration, unit tests
- [ ] 69-02-PLAN.md -- Inline query updates + validation schemas + admin gate
- [ ] 69-03-PLAN.md -- UI: upload form visibility options + VisibilityBadge

### Phase 70: MCP Preference Sync
**Goal**: Users' search preferences flow bidirectionally between the web UI and MCP tools
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel with Phase 69)
**Requirements**: VIS-06, VIS-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An authenticated MCP user can call a tool to read their current search preferences (preferred categories, default sort) and get the same values shown in the web UI
  2. An authenticated MCP user can call a tool to update their search preferences, and the changes appear in the web UI on next page load
  3. MCP search results for authenticated users are boosted by their preferred categories (matching web discovery behavior)
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 70-01-PLAN.md -- Preference CRUD: get_preferences + set_preferences actions in unified tool
- [x] 70-02-PLAN.md -- Search boost: preference reranking in search/recommend + defaultSort in list

### Phase 71: Temporal Tracking
**Goal**: Users can see what changed in skills since they last looked, reducing information overload
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel with Phases 69-70)
**Requirements**: TEMP-01, TEMP-02, TEMP-03, TEMP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After a user views a skill detail page, the system records the view timestamp and version number, and subsequent views to the same skill update this record
  2. Skill cards in search results and browse pages show an "Updated" badge when the skill has been modified since the user's last view
  3. The skill detail page shows a change summary section listing what changed since the user's last visit (version bumps, description updates, new feedback)
  4. The dashboard includes a "What's New" feed showing recently changed skills the user has previously interacted with
**Plans:** 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 71-01-PLAN.md -- DB foundation: user_skill_views schema, migration, service layer
- [ ] 71-02-PLAN.md -- View tracking + change summary on skill detail page (TEMP-01, TEMP-03)
- [ ] 71-03-PLAN.md -- Updated badge on skill cards + What's New dashboard feed (TEMP-02, TEMP-04)

### Phase 72: Community Detection
**Goal**: The system autonomously clusters skills into meaningful thematic communities using embedding similarity
**Depends on**: Nothing (parallel, but benefits from Phase 69 being done for correct visibility filtering)
**Requirements**: COMM-01, COMM-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running community detection on a tenant with 20+ published skills produces distinct communities where each community's member skills share thematic similarity (average intra-community cosine similarity > 0.5)
  2. Community assignments are persisted in the database with tenant isolation and can be refreshed via a cron endpoint without affecting live queries
  3. Running detection on a tenant with fewer than 20 published skills or a sparse graph gracefully falls back (no crash, no meaningless single-giant community)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 73: Community Discovery UI
**Goal**: Users can browse and explore skill communities to discover related skills they would not have found through search
**Depends on**: Phase 72 (communities must exist in the database)
**Requirements**: COMM-02, COMM-03, COMM-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each community has an AI-generated name and summary description that accurately reflects its member skills
  2. A discovery page section (or dedicated route) shows community cards with name, summary, member count, and top skills
  3. Clicking a community navigates to a detail page listing all member skills with their similarity scores to the community centroid
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 74: Adaptive Query Routing
**Goal**: Search queries are automatically classified and routed to the optimal retrieval strategy, making simple queries faster and complex queries smarter
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent; community_explore intent deferred to v8.0+)
**Requirements**: ROUTE-01, ROUTE-02, ROUTE-03, ROUTE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The system classifies each search query as keyword, semantic, hybrid, or browse and uses the appropriate retrieval strategy (observable via search analytics)
  2. Short keyword queries (1-2 words matching skill names) skip embedding generation and return results measurably faster than the current always-hybrid path
  3. Each search query's classified route type is logged in the search_queries table and visible in the search analytics dashboard
  4. A keyword search returning zero results automatically falls back to hybrid search, and the user sees results from the fallback without any manual intervention
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 75: RAGAS Benchmarking
**Goal**: Benchmark results provide 4-dimension quality insight (faithfulness, relevancy, precision, recall) alongside the existing overall score
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent)
**Requirements**: BENCH-01, BENCH-02, BENCH-03, BENCH-04, BENCH-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running a benchmark produces per-dimension scores (faithfulness, relevancy, precision, recall) for each model-test-case combination, stored in the benchmark_results table
  2. The benchmark results page displays a radar chart comparing dimension scores across models for a single benchmark run
  3. A per-dimension model comparison table shows each model's dimension scores side-by-side (e.g., "Sonnet: faithfulness 92, relevancy 88; Haiku: faithfulness 78, relevancy 75")
  4. The skill's benchmark summary view shows aggregate dimension scores across all benchmark runs for that skill
  5. Existing benchmark results with only an overall quality score continue to display correctly without errors or missing data
**Plans**: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases 69+70+71+72+74+75 can run in parallel (no cross-dependencies). Phase 73 depends on Phase 72.
Recommended sequencing: 69 -> 70 -> 71 -> 72 -> 73 -> 74 -> 75 (serial for focus, but parallelizable)
