- [x] **Phase 68: Pre-LLM History** - Upload historical work artifacts to demonstrate pre-platform impact (completed 2026-02-16)

#### Phase 62: Company IP Dashboard Core
**Goal**: Admins can see a company-wide IP dashboard with total skills captured, usage, hours saved, active contributors, and quality trends over time
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase -- builds on existing data in skills, usage_events, ratings, skill_feedback, token_measurements tables)
**Requirements**: IPDASH-01, IPDASH-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Admin navigates to a new IP Dashboard page (under /leverage) and sees hero stat cards: total skills captured, total uses, total hours saved, and active contributors for the tenant
  2. Admin sees an org-wide quality trends chart showing average quality scores, feedback sentiment, and benchmark results over time (monthly granularity, Recharts)
  3. Quality trend data is derived from existing skill_feedback, ratings, and benchmark_results tables without new schema
  4. The page is admin-only (RBAC-gated) and tenant-scoped, following the existing /leverage layout pattern
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 62-01-PLAN.md — Query module (hero stats + quality trends SQL) and nav tab
- [x] 62-02-PLAN.md — IP dashboard page, stat cards view, and quality trend chart

#### Phase 63: IP Risk Analysis
**Goal**: Admins can identify IP concentration risks -- which critical skills depend on a single author and would be lost if that person left
**Depends on**: Phase 62 (IP dashboard page must exist)
**Requirements**: IPDASH-02, IPDASH-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Admin sees an IP concentration risk section showing employees ranked by how much critical IP they solely own (single-author skills with high usage)
  2. Admin sees alert badges on skills where there is key person dependency -- single author, high usage, no forks
  3. Admin can drill down on any employee to see which high-value skills they are the sole author of
  4. Risk alerts surface proactively on the IP dashboard (not hidden behind a click) with amber/red severity indicators
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 63-01-PLAN.md — Risk query functions, server action, and sort hook (data layer)
- [x] 63-02-PLAN.md — IP Risk Section component and page wiring (UI layer)

#### Phase 64: IP Valuation & Export
**Goal**: Admins can see estimated replacement cost for high-value skills and export a complete IP report for board presentations
**Depends on**: Phase 62 (dashboard stats), Phase 63 (risk data)
**Requirements**: IPDASH-03, IPDASH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each high-value skill displays an estimated replacement cost based on usage volume, hours saved, complexity (instruction length, training examples count), and quality score
  2. Admin sees a total estimated IP value for the organization (sum of all skill replacement costs) as a hero stat on the IP dashboard
  3. Admin can export a PDF IP Report containing: executive summary, total IP value, top skills by value, risk assessment, quality trends, and contributor highlights
  4. Admin can export a CSV of all skill-level IP data (name, author, uses, hours saved, replacement cost, risk level) for spreadsheet analysis
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 64-01-PLAN.md — Replacement cost formula, SQL query, and server action (data layer)
- [x] 64-02-PLAN.md — Hero stat, valuation table, PDF/CSV export buttons (UI layer)

#### Phase 65: Individual Skills Portfolio
**Goal**: Users can view their personal skills portfolio showing what they've built, how much impact it's had, and which skills are portable vs company-owned
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of IP dashboard -- builds on existing /profile page and user-stats)
**Requirements**: PORT-01, PORT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User navigates to a portfolio page and sees their skills authored, total usage across all their skills, total hours saved, and their contribution ranking within the tenant
  2. User sees a clear breakdown of portable vs company IP -- personal-scoped skills (theirs forever regardless of employer) vs tenant-scoped skills (company's IP)
  3. Each skill in the portfolio list shows its visibility scope with a visual indicator (personal badge vs company badge)
  4. Portfolio stats include comparison context (e.g., "Top 15% of contributors" or "3rd highest impact")
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 65-01-PLAN.md — Data layer: portfolio queries (stats, skills, ranking) + nav link
- [x] 65-02-PLAN.md — UI layer: portfolio page, view component, and E2E test

#### Phase 66: Impact Measurement
**Goal**: Users can see how their contributions have grown over time and quantify the total value they've added to the company
**Depends on**: Phase 65 (portfolio page must exist with skill data)
**Requirements**: PORT-03, PORT-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees a skills impact timeline (Recharts) showing when they created or improved skills and cumulative impact (hours saved) growing over time
  2. User sees an impact calculator displaying total value added to the company: cumulative hours saved, estimated cost equivalent (hours * hourly rate), and skills improved via forks/suggestions
  3. The timeline distinguishes between skill creation events, fork events, and suggestion-implemented events as different markers
  4. Impact metrics update in real time as the user's skills accumulate more usage
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 66-01-PLAN.md — Data layer + components: timeline/calculator queries and chart/calculator components
- [x] 66-02-PLAN.md — Page wiring: integrate into portfolio page and E2E tests

#### Phase 67: Skills Resume
**Goal**: Users can generate a shareable, formatted summary of their skills and impact suitable for job applications and professional profiles
**Depends on**: Phase 65 (portfolio data), Phase 66 (impact metrics)
**Requirements**: PORT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can generate a "Skills Resume" that shows: skills authored (with categories), total impact (hours saved, people helped), quality achievements (Gold/Silver badges earned), and contribution timeline
  2. The resume is formatted for professional use -- clean layout, no internal jargon, emphasis on quantified impact (e.g., "Saved 120 hours across 45 team members")
  3. User can share the resume via a public URL (read-only, no auth required) or download as PDF
  4. Only portable/personal-scoped skills are included by default (company IP is excluded unless explicitly toggled on)
**Plans:** 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 67-01-PLAN.md — Schema, data queries, server actions, and middleware exemption (data layer)
- [x] 67-02-PLAN.md — Resume view, PDF download, share controls, public page, and E2E tests (UI layer)

#### Phase 68: Pre-LLM History
**Goal**: Users can upload historical work artifacts to demonstrate impact from before they started using the platform
**Depends on**: Phase 65 (portfolio page must exist to display historical contributions)
**Requirements**: PORT-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can upload pre-LLM work artifacts (documents, emails, templates, scripts) via a file upload interface on their portfolio page
  2. Uploaded artifacts are stored with metadata (title, date, category, description) in a new `work_artifacts` table with proper tenant scoping
  3. Uploaded artifacts appear in the user's portfolio timeline alongside platform-created skills, distinguished with a "Pre-platform" badge
  4. The system analyzes uploaded artifacts to suggest which existing skills in the catalog are relevant to the user's historical work (informing skill recommendations)
**Plans:** 3 plans
Plans:
- [x] 68-01-PLAN.md — Schema, migration, server actions, and portfolio query (data layer)
- [x] 68-02-PLAN.md — Upload form, artifact list, portfolio integration, and timeline visualization (UI layer)
- [x] 68-03-PLAN.md — AI skill analysis and E2E tests (intelligence + verification)

#### Dependency Graph

```
Phase 62 (IP Dashboard Core) ──> Phase 63 (IP Risk Analysis) ──> Phase 64 (IP Valuation & Export)

Phase 65 (Individual Portfolio) ──> Phase 66 (Impact Measurement) ──> Phase 67 (Skills Resume)
                                │
                                └──> Phase 68 (Pre-LLM History)
```

**Parallel execution opportunities:**
- Wave 0: Phase 62 + Phase 65 (IP Dashboard Core and Individual Portfolio are independent -- one is admin, one is user)
- Wave 1: Phase 63 + Phase 66 + Phase 68 (Risk Analysis depends on 62; Impact Measurement and Pre-LLM History depend on 65)
- Wave 2: Phase 64 + Phase 67 (IP Valuation & Export depends on 62+63; Skills Resume depends on 65+66)

**Note:** The two main tracks (company IP dashboard and individual portfolio) are fully independent and can be built in parallel. Phase 64 is the only phase that depends on two prior phases (62+63). Phase 68 (Pre-LLM History) is the only phase requiring new schema.

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute respecting dependencies: 62+65 (parallel) -> 63+66+68 (parallel) -> 64+67 (parallel)
