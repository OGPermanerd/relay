<objective>
Present homepage layout research for user evaluation and variant selection.

Purpose: Phase 47 is a research-only phase. The research document (47-RESEARCH.md) is already complete with full current homepage inventory, 3 detailed layout variants with ASCII wireframes, data source mappings, component reuse analysis, a comparison matrix, and a recommendation. This plan verifies completeness and captures the user's variant selection to feed Phase 48 (Homepage Redesign).

Output: User decision on which variant to implement, documented in the phase summary.

  <name>Task 1: Verify research document completeness</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/47-homepage-research/47-RESEARCH.md</files>
  <action>
    Read the research document and verify it contains all required sections:
    1. Current homepage inventory (section order, data sources, reusable components)
    2. Marketplace platform research (at least 3 platforms analyzed)
    3. Three layout variants (A: Marketplace Hub, B: Category Gallery, C: Personalized Dashboard), each with:
       - ASCII wireframe
       - What changes from current
       - Pros and cons
       - Data source mapping
       - New vs reused components
    4. Comparison matrix across multiple criteria
    5. Recommendation with rationale

    If any section is missing or incomplete, add it. If all sections are present and thorough, confirm completeness with a brief summary of findings.

    Do NOT modify any code files. This is a research-only phase.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Confirm the research document contains: (1) inventory of 10 current homepage sections, (2) research on 6 marketplace platforms, (3) 3 variant wireframes, (4) comparison matrix with 10 criteria, (5) recommendation section with numbered rationale points.

  <decision>Select a homepage layout variant for Phase 48 implementation</decision>
  <context>
    The research document presents 3 layout variants for the EverySkill homepage, each inspired by successful marketplace platforms. The research recommends Variant A but the choice is yours.

    **Quick summary of variants:**

    **Variant A: "Marketplace Hub" (RECOMMENDED)**
    Inspired by Atlassian Marketplace + VS Code Extensions.
    Search-first hero with curated collection carousels below. Treats homepage as a marketplace storefront.
    - Search bar is the hero focal point
    - Category tiles (4 columns: Prompts, Workflows, Agents, MCP Tools)
    - Company Recommended and Trending as horizontal card rows
    - Leaderboard + compact "Your Leverage" widget at bottom
    - Strongest for: discovery focus, new user experience, mobile, scalability
    - 90% existing data reuse

    **Variant B: "Category Gallery"**
    Inspired by Notion Templates + Chrome Web Store.
    Large visual category tiles as primary navigation with editorial curation.
    - Search in header area (smaller, inline)
    - 2x2 large category tiles as the hero element
    - Company Picks in editorial 3-column grid + Leaderboard sidebar
    - Full-width Trending section
    - Strongest for: visual browsing, category discovery, appropriate for 4 categories
    - 85% existing data reuse

    **Variant C: "Personalized Dashboard"**
    Inspired by Slack App Directory + current EverySkill.
    Personal context up top, organizational context below, sidebar navigation.
    - Sidebar with category links + counts (sticky)
    - Personal momentum stats elevated to top
    - "Recommended for You" mixes company-recommended with preference-boosted results
    - NOT recommended: sidebar overkill for 4 categories, empty state problem for new users, hardest mobile responsive
    - 80% existing data reuse

  <options>
    <option id="variant-a">
      <name>Variant A: Marketplace Hub</name>
      <pros>Search-first matches user intent; enterprise marketplace pattern users recognize; 90% existing data; scales naturally; best new user experience; easy mobile responsive</pros>
      <cons>My Leverage loses tab prominence (becomes mini widget); more vertical scrolling; needs new category count query</cons>
    </option>
    <option id="variant-b">
      <name>Variant B: Category Gallery</name>
      <pros>Visually striking category tiles; editorial curated feel; large tiles work well for exactly 4 categories; clean browsable layout</pros>
      <cons>Search less prominent; large tiles use vertical space; less data-dense; needs category descriptions copywriting</cons>
    </option>
    <option id="variant-c">
      <name>Variant C: Personalized Dashboard</name>
      <pros>Personal context immediately visible; persistent sidebar navigation; closest to current layout (least change)</pros>
      <cons>Sidebar overkill for 4 categories; empty state for new users; hardest mobile responsive; least distinctive visual</cons>
    </option>
    <option id="variant-a-plus-b">
      <name>Hybrid A+B: Marketplace Hub with large category tiles</name>
      <pros>Combines search-hero with visually striking category tiles from Variant B; best of both discovery approaches</pros>
      <cons>May be too content-heavy above fold; needs careful visual hierarchy</cons>
    </option>
  </options>
  <resume-signal>Select: variant-a, variant-b, variant-c, or variant-a-plus-b (or describe a custom preference)</resume-signal>
