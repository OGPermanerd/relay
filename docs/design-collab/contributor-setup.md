# Design Contributor Setup Guide

This guide gets you from zero to running EverySkill locally so you can experiment with design changes and propose them via pull request.

## Prerequisites

1. **Git** — `winget install Git.Git` (Windows) or `brew install git` (Mac)
2. **Node.js 22+** — `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` (Windows) or `brew install node@22` (Mac)
3. **Docker Desktop** — `winget install Docker.DockerDesktop` (Windows) or download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
4. **Claude Code** — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

## Step 1: Get Repository Access

Ask Trevor to add your GitHub account as a collaborator on the repo. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one at https://github.com.

## Step 2: Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OGPermanerd/relay.git ~/everyskill
cd ~/everyskill
```

## Step 3: Set Up Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and fill in any credentials Trevor sends you.

## Step 4: Start the Database

```bash
# Start the database in Docker
pnpm docker:up

# Wait a few seconds, then set up the schema
pnpm db:push
```

## Step 5: Install Dependencies and Run

```bash
pnpm install
cd apps/web && pnpm dev
```

The app is now running at **http://localhost:2002**. Open it in **Microsoft Edge** for pen annotation support.

## Daily Workflow

### Starting your day
```bash
cd ~/everyskill
git pull
pnpm install
pnpm docker:up
cd apps/web && pnpm dev
```

### Working with Claude Code
Open a terminal in the project directory and run `claude`. You can say things like:

- **"Try making the header background a gradient from #1a1a2e to #16213e"**
- **"Make the nav links larger and add more spacing"**
- **"Use the logo at Downloads\new-logo.svg"**

Claude will edit the code and you'll see changes live at http://localhost:2002.

### When you like a change
Say: **"Propose this change"** — Claude creates a branch, commits, pushes, and opens a PR.

### Leaving feedback without code changes
Say: **"Leave feedback: the spacing on the dashboard feels too tight"** — Claude logs it for Trevor to review.

### Visual annotations (Surface / tablet)
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+S** in Edge to capture and annotate with your pen
2. Save the annotated screenshot
3. Tell Claude: "See my notes at Desktop\feedback.png"

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `npm: command not found` | Reopen PowerShell after installing Node.js |
| `docker: command not found` | Install Docker Desktop and restart terminal |
| Database connection error | Run `pnpm docker:up` and wait 10 seconds |
| Port 2002 already in use | Kill the old process: `npx kill-port 2002` |
