# EverySkill Design Contributor — Getting Started

Hi Karin! This gets you set up to give design feedback and try out visual changes on EverySkill. Your Claude will send everything to Trevor's Claude through git — no email or copy-paste needed.

## One-time setup (15 minutes)

### 1. Install everything from PowerShell

Open **PowerShell** (search for it in the Start menu) and run these commands one at a time:

```powershell
winget install Git.Git
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
winget install Docker.DockerDesktop
```

Close PowerShell and reopen it (so it picks up the new tools), then run:

```powershell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Open Docker Desktop** from the Start menu and let it finish starting up (you'll see a whale icon in your taskbar). It needs to be running whenever you work on EverySkill.

### 2. Set up your GitHub account

If you don't have one already:
1. Create an account at https://github.com
2. Send Trevor your GitHub username so they can give you access to the project

### 3. Run Claude Code for the first time

Open **PowerShell** and type:

```
claude
```

Claude will start up and ask you to sign in. Follow the prompts to connect your Anthropic account.

### 4. Let Claude set up the project

Once Claude is running, paste this message:

```
I'm Karin, a design contributor for EverySkill. Please help me get set up:

1. Clone https://github.com/OGPermanerd/relay.git into a folder called everyskill in my home directory
2. Read the CLAUDE.md to understand the design collaboration workflow
3. Tell me you're ready and explain what I can do
```

Claude will clone the project and read the instructions. You're done with setup!

## How to start a feedback session

Any time you want to give feedback or try design changes, open **PowerShell** and type:

```
cd ~/everyskill
claude
```

Make sure **Docker Desktop** is running (whale icon in taskbar), then say something like:

> "Hi! I want to try some design changes today."

Claude will pull the latest code, start the local app, and open it in your browser at http://localhost:2002. Then just tell it what you want to change.

## What you can do

### Browse and comment page by page
Open http://localhost:2002 in **Microsoft Edge** and click around. As you visit each page, tell Claude what you think:

- "I'm on the home page — the hero section feels cramped"
- "Now I'm looking at the dashboard — the table rows need more breathing room"
- "The profile page is nice but the stats should be more prominent"
- "The navigation is hard to find"

Claude collects all your comments and sends them to Trevor as one organized feedback package when you're done. Say **"send my feedback"** when you're ready.

### Annotate with your pen (Surface / tablet)
You can circle things, draw arrows, and write notes directly on the screen — then share them with Claude:

1. In **Edge**, press **Ctrl+Shift+S** (or click the **screenshot** icon in the toolbar)
2. Select the area you want to comment on
3. Use the **pen tool** to circle, underline, or draw arrows on the capture
4. Click **Save** and put it somewhere easy to find (like your Desktop or Downloads folder)
5. Tell Claude: **"See my notes at Desktop\page-feedback.png"**

Claude reads the image, sees your circles and handwritten notes, and includes them in the feedback PR for Trevor. This works great on a Surface with a pen — just mark up what you see and let Claude handle the rest.

### Try out design changes
Describe what you want to see — Claude makes the change and you refresh your browser to see it instantly:

- "What if we used a warmer color palette? Think sunset tones"
- "Make the header a gradient instead of flat"
- "Try making the logo bigger"
- "What would it look like with rounded cards instead of a table?"

Keep going back and forth until you like it. Then say **"propose this"** and Claude sends it to Trevor.

### Create and test logos and assets
You can design new assets right in the conversation:

- "Create an alternative logo — something more minimal"
- "Make a dark version of that logo too"
- "Try it on the site" — Claude swaps it in and you refresh to see how it looks
- "I prefer the first version, use that one"

You can also use your own files — just tell Claude where the file is:

- "Use the logo I saved at Downloads\new-logo.svg"
- "Try the icon at Desktop\bell-icon.png for the notification bell"

Claude will test it on your local site and include the asset files in the proposal.

### Wrap up a session
When you're done:

- "That's all for today, send everything to Trevor"

Claude will make sure all your feedback, design changes, and assets are committed and pushed as pull requests.

## What happens after you submit?

1. Trevor's Claude sees your pull request
2. It reads your feedback and the exact code changes
3. Trevor reviews it and either merges it (goes live!), tweaks it, or discusses with you
4. You'll see the PR status on GitHub

## How the local site works

When you open http://localhost:2002, you're running a **full copy of the real EverySkill app** on your computer — the same code, the same pages, the same styling. It's not a mockup. When Claude changes a color or swaps a logo, you're seeing exactly how it would look on the real site.

The only difference is that your local database starts with sample data, not the real production data. So you'll see realistic-looking pages with test content.

Your changes only exist on your computer and your branch — the live site is never affected until Trevor approves your proposal.

## Tips

- **You can't break anything** — your changes go on a separate branch, never the live site
- **Be specific** — "the blue on the header" is better than "the thing on the page"
- **Annotate with your pen** — use Edge's screenshot tool (Ctrl+Shift+S) to circle and mark up the page, save it, then tell Claude the file path
- **It's OK to change your mind** — "undo that" or "go back to how it was" works
- **Each session is fresh** — Claude pulls the latest code at the start

## Quick reference

| You say | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "I'm on the dashboard — the spacing is off" | Claude logs feedback for that page |
| "Send my feedback" | Claude packages all comments into a PR for Trevor |
| "Try making the header lighter" | Claude edits code, you refresh browser to see it |
| "Create a new logo — something more geometric" | Claude designs an SVG and tests it on the site |
| "Use the logo at Downloads\new-logo.svg" | Claude swaps it in, refresh to see it |
| "See my notes at Desktop\feedback.png" | Claude reads your annotated screenshot and logs the feedback |
| "I like this, propose it" | Claude commits + pushes + opens a PR |
| "Undo that" | Claude reverts the change |
| "Wrap up my session" | Claude sends any remaining work as PRs |

## Need help?

Just ask Claude — it knows the entire codebase. Or message Trevor.
